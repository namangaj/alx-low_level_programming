0x18. C - Dynamic libraries Project
A dynamic library is a programming concept in which shared libraries with special functionalities are launched only during program execution, which minimizes overall program size and facilitates improved application performance for reduced memory consumption. In most software programs, distributing specific functionalities into distinct modules allows loading as needed.
